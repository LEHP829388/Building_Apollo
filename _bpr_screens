Movement screens reference

Objective: Assess lower extremity movement capacity

WHY are screens useful? Because they uncover hidden deficits that can be corrected before they cause problems

HOW do screens uncover hidden deficits? By being honest measures of functional capacity that cannot be cheated with compensatory patterns

WHAT is a screen? A simple movement assessment tool that is hard to cheat, highly informative and makes invisible deficits visible

Three highly useful screens which offer valuable information about lower body capacity are:

- Sit and rise
- Single leg balance
- Resting squat position 


---> Sit and rise:

Why is this screen useful? Global indicator of lower body strength and mobility, validated indicator of falls risk and all cause mortality

How is the screen conducted?

Prompt: 
- Begin standing barefoot on firm ground
- Cross your legs, slowly lower down to the floor and rise again to standing without using your hands

How is the screen scored?
- Binary: PASS (can complete without pain) or FAIL (cannot complete or can complete but with pain)

What data can be gathered from the screen?
- visual observation for toe alignment, deformities, arch control
- exertion or pain grimace

What recommendations can be made from screen results?
- The inability to complete the screen is an indicator of deficient lower body function which should be further investigated and addressed



---> Single leg balance

Why is this screen useful? Indicator of lower extremity, proprioception, risk of injury 

How is the screen conducted?

Prompt: 
- Stand barefoot on one leg on firm, flat ground
- Maintain balance with eyes open (eyes closed for athletes who pass eyes open) for 60 seconds
- Done bilaterally
- Average of 3 trials can be recorded if time permits
- If you make an error, resume the single leg position again until the full 60 seconds has elapsed

* If not confident, conduct the screen close to something the person can hold onto for support if they lose balance

How is the screen scored?
- Binary: PASS (able to balance for 60 seconds without errors), or FAIL (unable to balance for 60 seconds without errors) 
- Error: hopping, holding onto something, placing other foot down on the ground

*If an error is made, resume balancing again until the full 60 seconds has elapsed
*If unable to complete, count the number of errors made in 60 seconds and track progress over time

Standard: 60 seconds without making an error (hopping, holding onto something, placing other foot down)

Athlete standard: 60 seconds with eyes closed (opening eyes is an error)

What data can be gathered from the screen?
- Visual observation of overall stability
- Breathing pattern (relaxed vs stressed)
- Observation of muscles being stressed (toe extensors, peroneals, toe flexors)

What recommendations can be made from screen results?
- The inability to complete the screen is an indicator of deficient stability which should be trained and devloped daily until the standard is met



---> Resting squat position 

Context:
- The ability to lower into and out of a resting squat position demonstrates functional capacity in the lower body. 
- The resting squat position serves as a master screen that measures baseline capacity the the feet, ankles, knees and hips. It also assesses pelvic control. 
- The inability to lower into and out of a resting squat position is an indicator that something fundamental is missing within the lower body system.

Prompt:
- Begin barefoot on firm level ground standing hip width apart with feet parallel
- Slowly lower down into a resting squat position without changing foot position or letting your heels lift up off the ground
- Stay in a comfortable, relaxed resting squat for 30 seconds while taking deep, calm breaths

Scoring: Binary - Yes or No
- YES: abile to complete the screen with no pain

Standard: The ability to slowly lower into a resting squat position, maintain it comfortably for 30 seconds and then slowly rise out of the squat with no pain

Athlete standard: 2 minutes

To restore ability to complete this screen, spend time everyday in a resting squat position (assisted as needed with counterbalance, elevated heels, support assist)



While the inability to lower into a resting squat doesn't tell us exactly what isn't functioning, it does tell us that there is a restriction within the lower body system


Qualitative and quantitative scoring

Observations:


RAW:
---> Resting squat

Prompt: 
- Barefoot on flat, hard ground
- Stand hip width apart with feet parallel and slowly lower down into a resting squat position while keeping feet parallel and heels on the ground
- Spend 2 minutes in the bottom position while taking deep, calm breaths

Questions to ask:
- Do you have any pain?
- What are you feeling?
- What is stopping you from being able to get down into the resting squat?
- Can you take deep, easy breaths?

Qualitative elements: What restrictions are present (pain, ankle mobilty, hip mobility, quad dominance)
- Observations: pelvic position, toes and tibialis anterior activity

Quantitative score: binary yes (they can do it) or no (they cannot do it)

Standard: ability to remain in a deep resting squat position for 2 minutes without strain, pain and while being able to take deep, easy diaphragmatic breaths
