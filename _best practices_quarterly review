INTRO:

Thanks for being here

This is a safe space for disagreement and we encourage everyone to speak their truth

We aspire to hold ourselves to a higher standard

We can (and should) disagree on specifics but we must agree on the fundamentals

Best practices are the essential fundamentals for professional effectiveness

Best practices are a higher standard that we can all aspire to hold ourselves to

As we shift from disease care to healthcare we have an opportunity to pioneer a new path

Best practices are the gold standard expectation for lower extremity health professionals

What is a health professional? Define it

If you agree with best practices, please help us build consensus by endorsing them

Concept: behaviour as software

A major goal is to have rehab and medical schools endorse and teach best practices in their programs

* The importance of sharing and spreading best practices
* Building consensus by professional endorsements
* Consensus as a proxy for truth. More endorsements = closer to truth. A shared agreement that BP's are valid, good and serve as a gold standard
