Hello NOSTR üëãüèΩ

We‚Äôre building a free & open source foot health protocol so everyone can restore healthy, strong, painfree feet

Trusting disease care professionals (3rd party intermediaries) who treat symptoms without ever addressing the root cause is silly

We‚Äôre building the protocol in the open on top of #Bitcoin & #NOSTR

Your body is your node. Run better software and you will achieve better health

Our mission: develop a simple foot health protocol that can be applied by individuals to effectively restore healthy feet
Why?

Because 75% of shod people develop foot problems at some point in their lives

Because fiat incentives in disease care are broken. Professionals are trained and paid to treat symptoms without ever acknowledging or addressing the root cause of issues

Because people deserve truthful information that empowers them to take better care of their bodies

Because 95% of shod people are literally wearing shoes that disable, damage and deform their feet

We develop Health Software for human hardware

Don‚Äôt trust us

Run the software and verify for yourself

Core elements:

1) Adopt a low time preference

2) Stop wearing unnatural shoes

3) Spend at least10 minutes a day upgrading your lower body

Simple

The core problems we‚Äôre solving:

Problem 1: 95% of shoe wearing people are unknowingly wearing shoes that damage their feet

Problem 2: When people develop foot pain/injury, they trust ‚Äúexperts‚Äù to fix the problem but these [disease care] professionals are trained and financially incentivized to treat symptoms without ever addressing the root cause which is primarily shitty shoes

We‚Äôre dematerializing foot disease care with an open source protocol that helps people take care of their feet so they can prevent and cure foot issues

This protocol can also be adopted by professionals who want to do better for their patients

The protocol doesn‚Äôt include anything novel or groundbreaking. 

It‚Äôs effectiveness comes from helping people focus on core behaviours that matter most and trimming all the fiat disease care noise

Peer review: #Bitcoin style

Peer review in fiat academia is mostly bullshit. We‚Äôre doing it Bitcoin style by tracking down proof of work authorities (not proof of degree authorities) to review our code and validate it

We‚Äôre currently building a list of the top 50 foot health authorities in the world to review and validate our code (aka to read, understand, align with and endorse our protocol)

We pay them sats for their time and input

We plan to eventually gather a council of developers each month on a podcast to discuss and scrutinize the protocol

Applications of the protocol will vary widely and can be very complex but the protocol itself is incredibly simple

The protocol is behavioural software designed for human hardware. It only works when individuals apply it in their lives

It must be energized by our time and attention

3 core elements:

1) Adopt a low time preference
2) Stop wearing unnatural shoes
3) Spend at least 10 minutes a day recalibrating your lower body

The protocol is grounded in biological axioms

It‚Äôs value doesn‚Äôt come what it includes, but in all the noise that is excludes so that people can focus their energy on the things that matter most

Body = Node

Think of your body as your node. You only get one, and you get to decide what software you run

Human software = the behaviours we do everyday

Run good software and your node remains healthy

Translated: use your body in alignment with what your biology is built for (good software) and you will be given a lifetime of physical health

You will develop a body that is strong, mobile, free of pain and resilient

Run shitty software and your node will break down and give you constant problems

Translated: use your body in unnatural ways and you will suffer from pain and dysfunction

You will damage your hardware and unintentionally develop a body that is fragile

Most people are unintentionally running malware on their nodes

We‚Äôre developing an open source software protocol for the human lower body. A protocol that optimizes lower body health

A protocol that any human can run if they energize it with their time and effort

We‚Äôre cutting out 3rd party intermediaries (medical & rehab professionals) because they‚Äôre currently doing a shitty job of helping people

They‚Äôre trained in a legacy system and operate within fiat incentives which causes them to treat symptoms of problems without ever understanding or helping people resolve the root cause

It‚Äôs insanity

We welcome them to run our software and to align their treatments with the protocol if they want to stay relevant

Rant over

Adaptive Hardware

As humans, we have some amazing hardware

Like magical alien level gear

It‚Äôs self healing, self organizing and it adapts directly to the inputs we provide it

Hardware is the physical body

The bones, joints, muscles and nervous system components that coordinate physical movement

Software is the behaviours we do each day

It‚Äôs the operating system we load onto our hardware

Use shitty software and you damage the hardware

Use good software and you optimize and maintain the hardware

We develop free and open health software for human hardware

Simple protocols that can be applied by any individuals to achieve better health

Don‚Äôt trust us. Run the software and verify for yourself

Insight:

An effective foot health protocol is a de facto lower body health protocol

Lower body = integrated system

Dis-integration disables effectiveness

Our protocol branding will be Godlike

Simple

Meaningful

Clean

A light that shines through the darkness of fiat incentives

A human health protocol

Unstoppable truth

Building a culture of high standards

As we leave the paradigm of disease care behind and pioneer a new healthcare paradigm, setting high standards is important

We feel that building a culture of high standards is well worth the effort and has significant benefits

Ultimately, high standards create a better service for patients & clients. This is most important

Less obvious: people are drawn to high standards. Growth minded professionals want to master their craft and will gravitate towards standards that nudge them towards excellence in their practice

A culture of high standards reinforces a reputation of excellence among health professionals

In a culture of high standards, doing great work is it‚Äôs own reward. It‚Äôs part of what it means to be a professional

Four essential elements of high standards:

1) They are teachable

2) They are domain specific

3) They must be recognized

4) They must be explicitly coached

Best practices are about setting a new standard of care and a culture of excellence among lower extremity health professionals
