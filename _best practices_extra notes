- Achieving better health across a civilization doesnâ€™t happen by improving our disease care systems, it happens by creating healthcare systems
- Best practices are a seed from which new business models and social incentives can grow from. The 5 practices are in essence saying that if you are a lower extremity health professional, it is expected that you are educating the people you serve about mindset, movement, footwear and pain and that you are screening movement
- If as a community of health professionals we can agree that these are fair and reasonable practices and that they encompass a new standard of care, we can create a new system built on effectiveness and first principles thinking

--> Setting high standards:
- Building a culture of high standards is well worth the effort and there are massive benefits
- Most obviously, high standards create a better service for patients/customers
- Less obvious: people are drawn to high standards
- A culture of high standards reinforces a reputation and shared aspiration of excellence among health professionals
- In a culture of high standards, doing work well is its own reward, it's part of what it means to be a professional
- Once people have tasted high standards, there is no turning back
- Four elements of high standards: they are teachable, they are domain specific, we must recognize them, must be explicitly coache\d


--> Proximate vs. root causes:
- Proximate = what immediately caused something to happen
- Root = the real reason something happened
- The goal is to uncover, understand and address the root causes of LE dysfunction, not treat the proximate cause





PREVIOUS ITERATIONS

This document is updated quarterly by a community of lower extremity health professionals who wish to establish consensus best practices for the prevention and resolution of lower extremity dysfunction. We seek to move beyond treating symptoms without addressing root causes and reclaim effectiveness in our work. We have established six critical practices which serve as a gold standard for effective care. Consensus is achieved through endorsements from professionals as a method to signal agreement and validate effectiveness. Each practice includes a reference document which offers a deeper explanation and practical guidance for application. 

It's no longer acceptable to treat symptoms without addressing root causes. Best practices are required to establish a standard of care among health professionals. This document is for professionals who aspire to help individuals prevent and resolve lower extremity dysfunction. It includes six critical practices which serve as a gold standard for effective care. Consensus is achieved through professional endorsement which signals agreement and validates effectiveness. 

Health professional is defined as an individual whose primary profession is helping others restore natural function and the lower extremity is a subsystem of the body which includes hip, thigh, knee, leg, ankle and foot. Natural function is defined as strong, stable, mobile, resilient and free of longstanding pain. In order to restore natural function, the lower extremity must be protected from unnatural behaviours and exposed to natural behaviours [1]. 

It is expected that health professionals apply best practices in their own lives and orient their offerings around helping individuals restore natural function. Pain is a significant consideration but improved function is the objective. Best practices include footwear education, functional assessments, pain education and guidance on making sustainable lifestyle changes. 

If you are a health professional and agree with these best practices, please consider helping us build consensus by endorsing them. If you disagree with them, please consider participating in a quarterly roundtable discussion with fellow professionals to share your disagreement. This document is updated quarterly by a council of professionals with varying specialties. 

Best practices checklist: 
- Footwear education (reduce time in unnatural footwear, advise natural footwear) [2]
- Chair audit (reduce chair sitting time, increase time on the ground)
- Balance screen. SL60 [3]
- Triple fold (resting squat position) [3]
- Daily session (walking, balance training, basic foot reconditioning of strength and mobility)
- Pain education

Thank you for holding yourself to a higher professional standard.

Thank you for helping us build consensus.

Feedback:
-->>Mac: 
- Levels to screens?
- Screens and audit are actionalble but pain and daily session feel too vague
- Define unnatural and natural
- Squat: 30 seconds. Aspire to 2min
- Unpack pain and daily session
- Pain: growth vs fixed mindset
- Add time preference 

RAW NOTES

Best practices are required to establish a standard of care among health professionals.

This document is written by professionals for professionals who aspire to help individuals prevent and resolve lower extremity dysfunction.

As a global community of lower extremity health professionals [1], we believe critical practices grounded in first principles are necessary for the provision of effective care. Best practices enable a new and better standard of care. We no longer accept treating symptoms without addressing root causes to be an acceptable standard of care. By endorsing these best practices, you agree with the best practices and are helping us build consensus.
This document is for professionals who treat lower extremity dysfunction and for those who aspire to become effective lower extremity health professionals. It includes up to date consensus best practices for preventing and resolving lower extremity dysfunction. We believe six critical practices serve as a gold standard for effective care and we achieve consensus by professional endorsement. 

We define health professional as an individual whose primary profession is helping others restore natural function and we define the lower extremity as a subsystem of the body which includes the hip, thigh, knee, leg, ankle and foot. We define natural function as strong, stable, mobile, resilient and free of longstanding pain. We assert that if the desired outcome is natural lower extremity function, the body must be protected from unnatural behaviours and exposed to natural behaviours [2]. 
As a community of aligned health professionals, we apply best practices in our own lives and focus our approach  around helping individuals restore natural function. Reduction of pain is a natural by-product of improved function and not the focus of our approach. Best practices include functional assessments [3], footwear education [4] and guidance on making sustainable lifestyle changes. 

We have an opportunity as a global community of health professionals to establish a new standard of excellence and move beyond the current status quo of treating symptoms without addressing root causes. These critical practices are enable us to effectively help people restore a healthy lower body. These are consensus best practices. We build consensus through professional endorsement. Any professional who endorses this paper agrees with best practices, applies them in their life and integrates them into their practice.

If you are a health professional and agree with these best practices, please consider endorsing them by visiting www.runningapollo.com/endorse. If you disagree with them, please consider participating in a quarterly roundtable discussion with fellow professionals to share your disagreement. Best practices are reviewed and updated quarterly.
